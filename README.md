Practice reading assembly code from short and sweet C programs.

C files in `src/` are already compiled into the ISA folders so you don't have to install the toolchains. For example, `src/strop.c` gets compiled into `rv32i/strop.s` and `x86-64/strop.s`

Only rv32i and x86-64 are supported for now.

Feel free to add more short and sweet C programs into `src/` and submit PRs :)
